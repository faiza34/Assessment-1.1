<!--2. Create Heading -->

# RMarkdown ***editing***

<!-- 3. Sentences about RMarkdown -->

R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An R Markdown document is written in markdown and contains chunks of embedded R code. R Markdown files are designed to be used with the rmarkdown package.

<!-- 4. Give bold and italics to editing in Heading (***editing***), I use three times *** to show editing word as both bold and italics -->

<!-- 5. Include an in-text link -->

<!-- 6. Insert an R chunk and create a variable with the dataset. We do not need to use readr::read_csv to load data as that's the tidyverse package and we have already that one in library(tidyverse). Read_csv performs the same function and easy to code.-->

```{r}
#install.packages
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("skimr")

library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)

fastfood <-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-09-04/fastfood_calories.csv")

```
<!-- 7.	Display the first 10 rows of the dataset with the first 5 variables. 
For this, I have used 1:6 instead of 1:5 as the first column shows numbering and is not variable. For rows, I have added 10 in the fastfood column to make it easy to understand.-->

```{r}

knitr::kable(head(fastfood[, 1:6], 10), "pipe")

```
<!-- 8.	Display the observations that has more than 1000 calories.
For this, I have use the subset function of filter to include above 1000 calories and select the observations which are mainly linked to the variables such as restaurant and item. -->

```{r}

fastfood %>%
  subset(calories>1000, select=c(restaurant, item, calories))
  
```
<!-- 9.	Save observations with more than 40 in total_fat and more than 80 in total_carb in a new variable (dataset) called dont_eat_this. 
For this, I have use the mutate function to create a new variable dont_eat_this.-->

```{r}

fastfood %>%
  select(total_fat, total_carb) %>%
  filter(total_fat>"40", total_carb>"80")

dont_eat_this<- fastfood %>%
   mutate(dont_eat_this=as.numeric(total_fat>40 & total_carb>80))

#As this is a logical data, so the result would be either a boolean (TRUE or FALSE) or a numeric one by using as.numeric. The parse_number cannot be used here as it is showing error for two values. Now, with as.numeric, it is showing data as numeric in new variable dont_eat_this.

```

<!--10.	Using the initial dataset variable, display observations from restaurant Mcdonalds. 
For this, I filter the restaurant "Mcdonalds" to show only observations related to it-->

```{r}

fastfood %>%
  filter(restaurant=="Mcdonalds")

```
